    <p>The Golden Retriever is one of the most commonly kept breeds of companion dog in the Western
         world, and is often among the top ten dog breeds by number of registrations in the United 
         Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada. It is a frequent
          competitor at dog shows; separate show lines of the breed have been developed.
           The dogs can be trained as guide dogs and therapy dogs, and may compete in obedience
            trials and other dog sports.The Golden Retriever is still used as a gundog by sportsmen, both as a hunting 
    companion in the field and for competing in field trials.It is used more for 
    retrieval of land-based gamebirds such as grouse and partridge than for wildfowl hunting.
    Those used as gundogs are usually from working lines specifically bred for field use; dogs 
    from pet or show lines are rarely suitable. A Golden Retriever with a traditional 
    dense double coat is well suited to working in cold and wet conditions, as the coat provides
     water resistance and insulation.Compared to other retriever breeds, the Golden Retriever
      is not a strong swimmer; its long coat causes it to sit low in the water when swimming.
      The Golden Retriever is much less commonly used by sportsmen as a hunting companion
 than the Labrador Retriever.One reason is that the breed is generally quite slow to mature, 
 particularly compared to the Labrador; often when a Golden Retriever is still in basic training a 
 Labrador of the same age has already completed a season of hunting. Another is its long coat,
  which requires more maintenance and grooming than that of the Labrador, particularly after working 
  in muddy conditions or close cover, as their long hair is more prone to picking up dirt and burrs.
   More Golden Retrievers are bred as pets or for the show ring than for hunting, so it can be
   hard for sportsmen to find pups bred from proven working lines.
